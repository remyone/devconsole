## 🛠️ Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/remyone/devconsole.git
cd devconsole/
gcc main.c execution.c -o main
./main
```

## 🔥 Motivation
The main motivation is to learn some of C linux library functions (e.g. opendir) and increase familiarity with the `<string.h>` functions and parsing directories . Here are some of the concepts I've learned writing this program: 
- How to parse directories and take info from them
- How to work with [fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) and [exec](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html)
- Strengthen knowledge of token parsing (adding tokens to the buffer)
- How to find out about shell built-in functions (e.g. cd) via [compgen](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html) 

## 📌 @TODO 
### Shell work itself
 - [ ] Add a pipeline (1 and more)
