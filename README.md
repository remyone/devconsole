```bash
git clone https://github.com/remyone/devconsole.git
cd devconsole/
gcc main.c execution.c -o main
./main
```

## Motivation 🔥
The main motivation is to learn C linux library functions (e.g. opendir) and increase familiarity with the `<string.h>` functions and parsing directories . Here are some of the concepts I've learned writing this program: 
- How to parse directories and take info from them
- Creating of a child process with exec
- Strengthen knowledge of token parsing (adding tokens to the buffer)
- How to find out about shell built-in functions (e.g. cd) via [compgen](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html)
